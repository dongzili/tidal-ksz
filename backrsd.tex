We analyze the influence of linear redshift space distortion (RSD) in kSZ signal reconstruction. 
%After knowing this, we provide the very interesting result of taking advantage of the effect to get better cross correlation(Fig.\ref{fig:r}).
Equipped with it, we provide the very interesting results of adding RSD to simulations, 
and get better cross correlation (Fig.\ref{fig:r}). 
We also discuss another important advantage RSD brings.

The redshift distortions results from the radial peculiar velocity, 
which leads to a misjudgement of distance referring to Hubble flow.
%$\chi^{RSD}=\chi+\frac{v_z}{H}$, 
%where $\chi$ is the radial distance, $v_z$ is the parallel peculiar velocity.

In linear regions, it will induce an extra density contraction in redshift space:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:rsd}
\delta^{RSD}(\bm{k})\approx (1+f\mu(\bm{k})^2)\delta(\bm{k})\,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu(\bm{k})=\hat{k}\hat{v_z}, =\frac{k_z}{k}$,
and again $f=\frac{d\mathrm{ln}D}{d\mathrm{ln}a}$, 
with the cosmological parameter we choose, $f=1.5, z\sim1; f=0.96, z\sim2$. 

Therefore, the easiest way to substract the linear RSD is to 
devide the $\delta^{RSD}$ we have by $(1+f\mu(\bm{k})^2$ 
before all the calculations.

However, if we leave it here, since our foreground is in the same direction as the RSD, we will see some miracularly good effects.
%However, in our case, we have the foreground of the same direction as the RSD, we just leave it here and see the miracular effect it brings. 
We discuss both the case of non-tidal reconstruction group, 
and tidal reconstruction group, each case we will get better results.

(1) Building $\hat \Theta$ with RSD foreground substracted 21cm density field $\delta_fs^{RSD}.
\begin{eqnarray}
    \hat v_z^{RSD}(\bm{k})=\hat v_z(\bm{k})(1+f\mu(\bm{k})^2
    \propto \delta(\bm{k})(1+f\mu(\bm{k})^2\frac{k_z}{k^2}
\end{eqnarray}
